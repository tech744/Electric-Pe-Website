            <p>
              Pre-booking deposits (typically ₹500) are fully refundable within 48 hours
              of payment. After 48 hours, refunds are processed within 7 working days if
              you cancel before delivery.

            <h2 className="text-h2 mt-8">Test-ride deposits</h2>
            <p>
              Doorstep test-ride deposits (₹299) are automatically refunded within 24
              hours of the scheduled ride, regardless of purchase decision.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-h2 mt-8">Scooter returns</h2>
            <p>
              Because a scooter is a registered motor vehicle, we do not offer "change
              of mind" returns once delivery is complete. If your scooter has a
              manufacturing defect, we will replace affected parts under warranty at no
              cost. See <Link href="/warranty" className="text-[var(--color-brand)] underline">warranty policy</Link>.
              In the rare case of a catastrophic defect within 7 days of delivery, we
              will replace the entire vehicle at our sole discretion.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-h2 mt-8">Charger returns</h2>
            <p>
              Home chargers may be returned within 7 days of delivery if unopened and
              unused. Return shipping is covered by ElectricPe if the reason is a defect
              on our side; otherwise borne by the customer. Refund processed within 7
              working days of receipt.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-h2 mt-8">How to request a return</h2>
            <p>
              WhatsApp us at the number on your order confirmation, or email{" "}
              <a href="mailto:support@electricpe.com" className="text-[var(--color-brand)] underline">

              with your order reference. We acknowledge within one business day and

            <h2 className="text-h2 mt-8">Refund method</h2>
            <p>
              All refunds are processed to the original payment method. UPI refunds
              typically clear in 1–3 business days; card and net-banking refunds may
              take 5–7 business days depending on your bank.
